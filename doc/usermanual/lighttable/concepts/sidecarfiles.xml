		<para>darktable is a non-destructive image editor. This implies that darktable opens input images read-only. Any newly added metadata, tags and
                parameters of image operations (history stack) are stored in a separate file, a so called sidecar or XMP file.
                </para>
                <para>For a given source image multiple edits, called duplicates, can co-exist - sharing the same input (RAW) data but each having their individual
                set of metadata, tags and history stack. Each duplicate is represented by a separate XMP sidecar file with a filename constructed in the form 
                <quote>&lt;basename&gt;<emphasis>_nn</emphasis>.&lt;extension&gt;.xmp</quote>, where <emphasis>nn</emphasis> represents the (minimum two digit)
                version number of that edit. The duplicate with version number zero is represented by sidecar file <quote>&lt;basename&gt;.&lt;extension&gt;.xmp</quote>.
                The version number of a duplicate is displayed as part of the metadata in the image information panel in each of darktable's views
                (see for example <xref linkend="image_information"/>).
                </para>
                <para>
                Sidecar files get synchronized automatically by darktable without the need to press a <quote>save</quote> button.
                When backing up your data, make sure you also save the XMP files, as this is needed to fully reconstruct your work in case of a disaster.
                </para>
                <para>In addition to the sidecar files darktable keeps all image related data in its database for fast access.
